# Solar Dashboard: Tracking, Simulating, and Optimizing Solar Energy in Zwolle

## Overview

The **Zwolle Solar Dashboard** is an interactive, district-level decision-support tool designed to guide Zwolleâ€™s transition to solar energy. Developed as part of a climate transition intervention, it allows policymakers, planners, and cooperatives to monitor current energy trends and explore rooftop solar adoption scenarios. The dashboard supports Zwolleâ€™s target of generating 201 GWh of solar electricity annually by 2030.

## Key Features

- **District-Level Visualization**  
  View current energy consumption (electricity and gas), existing solar generation, and grid load capacity for specific districts, starting with Stadshagen.

- **Scenario-Based Simulation**  
  Simulate solar adoption scenarios based on:
  - Building type (residential, industrial, other, large roofs)
  - Roof suitability (Level 1â€“3)
  - Adoption rate (25%â€“100%)

- **Energy Generation & ROI Estimates**  
  Calculate potential solar output, number of panels, storage needs, and investment costs.

- **Economic Feasibility Analysis**  
  Estimate payback periods for solar panels and battery storage systems using Dutch-specific financial tools:

  - [Jeroen.nl](https://jeroen.nl/over/thuisbatterijen)

- **Governance and Policy Integration**  
  Designed in consultation with local stakeholders, including the Municipality of Zwolle and energy cooperative Blauwvinger Energie.

## Repository Contents

- `/Solar Dashboard_Streamlit/`: Main Streamlit application files
- `/All Data/`: Processed geospatial and statistical datasets
- `simulation.html`: Energy and storage modeling outputs (visual)
- `README.md`: This file


## In order to get started, follow the steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoanWaithira/ZwolleSolarDashboard.git
   cd ZwolleSolarDashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run Solar\ Dashboard_Streamlit/app.py
   ```

## Data Sources

- **Geospatial Data**: Zwolle building footprints and roof suitability (ITC Disc Lab)
- **Energy Data**: Enexis (grid and solar generation), CBS (consumption)
- **Solar Simulation**: [PVGIS](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/pvgis) by the European Commission
- **Grid Capacity**: Netbeheer Nederlandâ€™s Capacity Map

## Current Focus Area: Stadshagen

The prototype implementation focuses on the Stadshagen district, analyzing:
- Energy consumption and solar potential
- Grid capacity limitations
- Residential adoption patterns and payback scenarios

## Roadmap

- [ ] Expand to neighborhood (buurt) level analysis using CBS buurt data
- [ ] Enable district stacking to simulate municipality-wide solar impact
- [ ] Integrate simulation of large-scale solar/wind farm projects
- [ ] Allow energy cooperatives to upload and test their own data

## Governance & Stakeholder Alignment

The dashboard is envisioned as a **planning and communication tool** embedded in Zwolle's annual climate strategy cycle. It facilitates participatory governance, evidence-based policy development, and transparent monitoring of energy transition progress.
